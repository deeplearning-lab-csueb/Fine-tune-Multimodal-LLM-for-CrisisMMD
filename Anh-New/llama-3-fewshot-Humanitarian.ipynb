The damage should be obvious and significant.\\n3: OTHER CRISIS INFO - Shows verified crisis-related content that doesn't fit above categories: maps of affected areas, emergency warnings, official updates, or documentation of crisis conditions. Must have clear connection to the current disaster.\\n4: NOT CRISIS-RELATED - Use this for:\\n- Images where you're unsure if it's related to the crisis\\n- General photos that could be from any time/place\\n- Images without clear crisis impact or response\\n- Stock photos or promotional images\\n- Any image that doesn't definitively fit categories 0-3\\n\\nImportant:\\n- If there's ANY sign of rescue or donation, pick 1.\\n- If there's ANY sign of damage, pick 2.\\n- If there's ANY sign of obviously distressed or harmed people, pick 0.\\n- If it's definitely about a crisis but you DO NOT see rescue/damage/impacted people, pick 3.\\n- Otherwise, pick 4.

The damage should be obvious and significant.\\n3: OTHER CRISIS INFO - Must be about verified crisis-related content that doesn't fit above categories: maps of affected areas, emergency warnings, official updates, or documentation of crisis conditions. Must have clear connection to the current disaster.\\n4: NOT CRISIS-RELATED - Use this for:\\n- Images and text where you're unsure if they are related to the crisis\\n- General texts and photos that could be from any time/place\\n- Texts and images without clear crisis impact or response\\n- Texts are not related to a crisis with stock photos or promotional images\\n- Any text and image that doesn't definitively fit categories 0-3\\n\\nImportant:\\n- If there's ANY sign of rescue or donation, pick 1.\\n- If there's ANY sign of damage, pick 2.\\n- If there's ANY sign of obviously distressed or harmed people, pick 0.\\n- If the text and image are definitely about a crisis but you DO NOT see rescue/damage/impacted people, pick 3.\\n- Otherwise, pick 4.

The damage should be obvious and significant.\\n3: OTHER CRISIS INFO - Must be about verified crisis-related content that doesn't fit above categories: maps of affected areas, emergency warnings, official updates, or documentation of crisis conditions. Must have clear connection to the current disaster.\\n4: NOT CRISIS-RELATED - Use this for:\\n- Images and text where you're unsure if they are related to the crisis\\n- General texts and photos that could be from any time/place\\n- Texts and images without clear crisis impact or response\\n- Texts are not related to a crisis with stock photos or promotional images\\n- Any text and image that doesn't definitively fit categories 0-3\\n\\nImportant:\\n- If there's ANY sign of rescue or donation, pick 1.\\n- If there's ANY sign of damage, pick 2.\\n- If there's ANY sign of obviously distressed or harmed people, pick 0.\\n- If the text and image are definitely about a crisis but you DO NOT see rescue/damage/impacted people, pick 3.\\n- Otherwise, pick 4.
